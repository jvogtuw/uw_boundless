# UW Boundless Theme

This Bootstrap 3.x subtheme replicates the WordPress theme developed by UW Marketing & Communications (https://github.com/uweb/uw-2014).

Maintaining this theme is currently a volunteer effort provided by the UW Drupal Community. We do our best to keep the theme up to date with the UMAC version.

**Questions?** Contact the maintainers at drupal-theme@uw.edu.

*The Drupal Boundless theme was originally developed by Creative Communications.*

## Requirements

1. The [Bootstrap 3.x](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap) base theme.
2. jQuery 1.10 minimum. Install the [jQuery Update](http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update) module to manage your jQuery version.
3. Your site's primary navigation uses a menu called "Main menu."

### Recommendation:

For simplified navigation of the Management menu, install the [Administration menu](https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_menu) module.
